## Introduction: 

The Clean Air Act has been designed to reduce levels of air pollution in the U.S., and this project is essentially doing some rough cut analyses to review how effective this has been in reducing levels of fine particulate air pollution levels, specifically. 

To do this, I have constructed 6 plots designed to answer 6 questions set forward in the assignment, as further outlined below, as well as in the R script files themselves. There are 13 files associated with this project that are also available in the folder - This README.md file, 6 R script files (plot1.R through plot6.R) and the corresponding 6 PNG files (plot1.png through plot6.png). 

Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an ambient air pollutant for which there is strong evidence that it is harmful to human health. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with setting national ambient air quality standards for fine PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant into the atmosphere. Approximatly every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on emissions of PM2.5. This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). You can read more information about the NEI at the EPA National Emissions Inventory web site.

For each year and for each type of PM source, the NEI records how many tons of PM2.5 were emitted from that source over the course of the entire year. The data that you will use for this assignment are for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

## Data Overview: 

Dataset is available at the path below: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip

This zip file contains two files: 
* PM2.5 Emissions Data (𝚜𝚞𝚖𝚖𝚊𝚛𝚢𝚂𝙲𝙲_𝙿𝙼𝟸𝟻.𝚛𝚍𝚜): This file contains a data frame with all of the PM2.5 emissions data for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. For each year, the table contains number of tons of PM2.5 emitted from a specific type of source for the entire year. Variable descriptions below: 
        + fips: A five-digit number (represented as a string) indicating the U.S. county
        + SCC: The name of the source as indicated by a digit string (see source code classification table)
        + Pollutant: A string indicating the pollutant
        + Emissions:  Amount of PM2.5 emitted, in tons
        + type: The type of source (point, non-point, on-road, or non-road)
        + year: The year of emissions recorded
        
* Source Classification Code Table (𝚂𝚘𝚞𝚛𝚌𝚎_𝙲𝚕𝚊𝚜𝚜𝚒𝚏𝚒𝚌𝚊𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗_𝙲𝚘𝚍𝚎.𝚛𝚍𝚜): This table provides a mapping from the SCC digit strings in the Emissions table to the actual name of the PM2.5 source. The sources are categorized in a few different ways from more general to more specific and you may choose to explore whatever categories you think are most useful. For example, source “10100101” is known as “Ext Comb /Electric Gen /Anthracite Coal /Pulverized Coal”.

**NOTE:** *Please ensure that these data files are in your current working directory prior to running the script below and in the files, or modified the paths to the data as needed* 

#### Code to read each of the two files: 

######This first line will likely take a few seconds. Be patient! 
NEI <-readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <-readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")


#### Code for Basic Review of the Files: 

str(NEI)
dim(NEI)
summary(NEI)
mean(is.na(NEI))


str(SCC)
dim(SCC)
summary(SCC)
mean(is.na(SCC))

##Questions and Corresponding Scripts: 
1. **Question 1**: Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? 
+ Corresponding Script - Plot1.R: Constructs a plot **using the base plotting system** that shows the *total* PM2.5 emission from all sources for the years 1999,2002,2005, and 2008 and saves the plot to a PNG file. 

2. **Question 2**: Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (𝚏𝚒𝚙𝚜 == "𝟸𝟺𝟻𝟷𝟶") from 1999 to 2008?
+ Corresponding Script - Plot2.R: Constructs a plot **using the base plotting system** and saves the plot to a PNG file. 

3. **Question 3**: Of the four types of sources indicated by the 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? 
+ Corresponding Script - Plot3.R: Constructs a plot **using the base ggplot2 system** and saves the plot to a PNG file.

4. **Question 4**: Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?
+ Corresponding Script - Plot4.R: Constructs a plot and saves the plot to a PNG file.

5. **Question 5**: How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?
+ Corresponding Script - Plot5.R: Constructs a plot and saves the plot to a PNG file.

6. **Question 6**: Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (𝚏𝚒𝚙𝚜 == "𝟶𝟼𝟶𝟹𝟽"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
+ Corresponding Script - Plot6.R: Constructs a plot and saves the plot to a PNG file.
